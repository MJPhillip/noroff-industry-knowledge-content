# Industry Knowledge Course Assignment

## Goal

To create your portfolio website.

## Brief

Take the Adobe XD prototype created in MA2 and turn it into a professional portfolio website that you can send to potential employers and use to attract freelance clients.

## Level 1 Process

The process you follow for the development of your site is up to you. You have two modules (two weeks full-time and four weeks part-time) to create this site. The site should be mobile responsive and display work you have done.

## Level 2 Process

You might choose to host the website on its own domain so that potential clients can find the site and contact you, but that is your choice.

## Delivery

A link to the finished portfolio website.
