# Module Assignment 1

## Goal

Start work on your portfolio website.

## Brief

As you are coming to the end of your studies and are looking at options in the workplace, it is important to create a portfolio website of work you have done.
Over the course of Industry Knowledge, you will be working on this portfolio website and will submit it for grading as your CA. In the next module assignment you will be creating an Adobe XD prototype of your portfolio website, so keep that in mind when choosing your pages.

In this first MA you will start on the content for the website.

## Level 1 Process

1.	Consider the target audience and their likely personas.
2.	Research other portfolio websites for ideas.
3.	Choose what you want to highlight for your portfolio. Is your portfolio programming-focused or design-focused?
4.	Decide on the content architecture for the site. How many pages should it have and which projects should make up the portfolio?
5.  Create a wireframe for the site.
6.	Submit a PDF of the wireframe.
